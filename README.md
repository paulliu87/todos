# TODOs

A Web App To-Do List.
The project goals are:
* As a user, I can add a TODO to the list.
* As a user, I can see all the TODOs on the list in an overview.
* As a user, I can drill into a TODO to see more information about the TODO.
* As a user, I can delete a TODO.
* As a user, I can mark a TODO as completed.
* As a user, when I see all the TODOs in the overview, if today's date is past the TODO's deadline, highlight it.
